JHU cleaning data project

This is the respository for the course project to the Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The files required to complete the project are:

README.md - this overview file.
run_analysis.R - the R script that runs all fo the analysis to create the tidy data set.
Cleaning data week 4 assignment.Rmd - also contains the code needed to create the tidy data set (i.e. this is the codebook).

The data used is contained within the UCI HAR Dataset.zip file.

To run the code one needs to run the script run_analysis.R to produce the tidy submission dataset in the file Summarised_by_mean.txt. 

The tidy submission data is described in the CodeBook.md file.
